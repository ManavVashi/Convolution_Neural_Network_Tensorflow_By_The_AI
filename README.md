# Convolution_Neural_Network_Tensorflow_By_The_AI

* I've designed my Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) code to be accessible for beginners, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. While a basic understanding of CNNs is necessary, I've included detailed comments and         explanations throughout the code to guide you through each step of the process. This repository is an excellent starting point for those new to CNNs, as it breaks down complex concepts into manageable parts. However, it's 
  important to note that some foundational knowledge in CNNs is assumed as it is not possible that all concepts can be fully explained within the code alone.
